Hi, welcome to my fist blog. I am currently learning to use GitHub pages, the tutorials are fun and easy to follow. I will try to document my journey of either becoming a professional in the cybersecurity field or in the ML/AI field. Although I am more inclined to choose cybersecurity, I am still exploring the two area to find out which one I find the most interesting.

Thank you for reading.
